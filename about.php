				<h3>Wendell Trading Inc.</h3>
				<p>Wendell Trading Inc. is a Paraguayan sugar mill that is dedicated to the production of sugar and molasses derived from crops grown by Paraguayan producers organized in cooperatives. Our sales are oriented to the most demanding international markets, such as those of the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, and Korea.  Locally, we sell our sugar exclusively to industries, wholesale suppliers and distributors across the country. </p>
				<p class="margin">We are the only sugar mill present in the country’s Western Region—or Chaco, and our growth has both accompanied and catalyzed the city of Benjamin Aceval’s development, which is where our sugar mill is located. Today, we can proudly say that we feel responsible for this progress and we value the multiplying effect our company has had in the zone.</p>
				<p class="margin">We count with a milling capacity of 120.000 tons of sugar cane, and production capacity of 12.000 tons of sugar per year. We employ 150 people directly, and 400 people indirectly per year. This includes truck drivers, wagon drivers, and sugar cane cutters and loaders.</p>
